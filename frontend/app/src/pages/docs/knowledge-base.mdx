# Knowledge Base

Knowledge base is a collection of documents and represents a certain knowledge domain, which can be used by LLM to answer users' questions.

## Configure Knowledge Base

1. Go to the admin panel;
2. Click on the `Knowledge Bases` tab;

    ![Knowledge Bases Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24e3686b-40f0-4738-8d45-02d9b8c945b0)

3. Click on the `New Knowledge Base` button to add a new knowledge base;

    ![Knowledge Base Creation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a332b0-b1de-42f2-a107-6b08c743b12d)

    Set up the following fields and click `Create` to create the knowledge base.

    | Field            | Description                                                                          | Required | Updatable |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | --------- |
    | Name             | The name of the knowledge base.                                                      | Yes      | Yes       |
    | Description      | Describe the knowledge base.                                                         | No       | Yes       |
    | LLM              | The LLM used during building vector index and knowledge graph index.                 | Yes      | No        |
    | Embedding Model  | the embedding model used by vector index and knowledge graph index.                  | Yes      | No        |
    | Indexing Methods | Vector index is forced to be enabled. The knowledge graph index is used by GraphRAG. | Yes      | No        |


4. Click the `Data Sources` tab and add a new data source.

5. Once the data source added, Autoflow will asynchronously import and index documents from the data source, you can check the progress in the `Index Process` tab.

6. Go to `Chat Engine` configuration page, select the knowledge base you created and click `Save` to enable it.

7. Done!

## Data Source Management

Each Knowledge Base could contain multiple data sources.

You can click the **Data Sources** tab to view all data sources.

![Data Sources Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc865796-3660-4e25-9218-9ad4efd0fb97)

### Create Data Source

You can click the button on top of data sources list to create new data sources.

Currently, AutoFlow supports three types of data sources:

- File uploads from local:
  - Markdown (\*.md)
  - PDF (\*.pdf)
  - Microsoft Word (\*.docx)
  - Microsoft PowerPoint (\*.pptx)
  - Microsoft Excel (\*.xlsx)
  - Text (\*.txt) files
- Website pages by sitemap.xml
- Certain web pages by URL

### Update Data source

You can rename data source by click the **Configure** button of data source.

### Delete Data source

You can delete data source by click the **Delete** button of data source.

<Callout>
  **This operation cannot be undone**.

  Deleting data sources will trigger an **asynchronous** deletion process for related **documents**, **chunks of vector index**
  and **entities and relationships of knowledge graph index**.

## Documents Management

You can manage documents in the **Documents** tab.

![Documents Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/878d2809-97a6-4a87-8d3a-3481f8bb863b)
