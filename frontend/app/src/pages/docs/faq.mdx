<FAQBox title="Why use TiDB which is a MySQL compatible database to store Knowledge Graph?">
  - TiDB is a distributed MySQL SQL database, it's easy to scale out and has a good performance;
  - TiDB is a multi-model database, it supports MySQL SQL, JSON, Vector, and more;
  - The performance of TiDB is enough to store and query the Knowledge Graph, as we just search the first-level or second-level neighbors of the node.
