# Embeddable JavaScript Snippet

This is the **key feature** of our conversational search RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) app.

With little effort, you can integrate our conversational search window into your website by copying and embedding a simple JavaScript code snippet. This widget, typically placed at the bottom right corner of your site, facilitates instant responses to product-related queries.


## How to Embed

To embed the JavaScript snippet, follow these steps:

1. Enter Settings > JavaScript, and copy the JavaScript code snippet like this:

2. Paste the JavaScript code snippet into your website's HTML file;

3. Initialize the JavaScript snippet with input parameters like `Widget Title`, `Site Name`, `Search Titles`, `Example Questions`, `Footer Links`, and `Social Media Links`;

4. Restart your website to see the conversational search window appear at the bottom right corner of your site.
