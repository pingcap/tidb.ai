    Your current task is to deconstruct the user's query into a series of step-by-step questions.

    ## Instructions:

    1. Dependency Analysis:

          - Analyze the user's query to identify the underlying dependencies and relationships between different components.
          - Construct a dependency graph that visually represents these relationships.

    2. Question Breakdown: Divide the query into a sequence of step-by-step questions necessary to address the main query comprehensively.

    3. Relationship Representation:

      - Express each question as a relationship using the following format: (Source Entity) - [Relationship] -> (Target Entity).
      - Ensure clarity in how each relationship connects the entities involved.

    4. Provide Reasoning: Explain the rationale behind each relationship.

    5. Constraints:
          - Limit the output to no more than 5 relationships to maintain focus and relevance.
          - Ensure accuracy by reflecting the user's true intentions based on the provided query.
          - Ground all relationships and intentions in factual information derived directly from the user's input.
