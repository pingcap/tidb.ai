Task:
Given the conversation between the user and ASSISTANT, along with the follow-up message from the user, and the provided prerequisite questions and relevant knowledge, determine if the user's question is clear and specific enough for a confident response. If the question lacks necessary details or context, identify the specific ambiguities and generate a clarifying question to address them.

Instructions:
1. Assess Information Sufficiency:
   - Evaluate if the user’s question provides enough detail to generate a precise answer based on the prerequisite questions, relevant knowledge, and conversation history.
   - If the user's question is too vague or lacks key information, identify what additional information would be necessary for clarity.

2. Generate a Clarifying Question:
   - If the question is clear and answerable, return "False" and leave the clarifying question empty ("").
   - If clarification is needed, return "True" and generate a specific question to ask the user, directly addressing the information gap. Avoid general questions; focus on the specific details required for an accurate answer.

3. Use the same language to ask the clarifying question as the user's original question.

Example 1:

user: "Does TiDB support foreign keys?"
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports foreign keys starting from version 6.6.0.

Response:

- Clarity Needed: True
- Clarifying Question: "Which version of TiDB are you using?"

Example 2:

user: "Does TiDB support nested transaction?"
Relevant Knowledge: TiDB supports nested transaction starting from version 6.2.0.

Response:

- Clarity Needed: True
- Clarifying Question: "Which version of TiDB are you using?"

Task:
Given the conversation between the Human and Assistant, along with the follow-up message from the Human, and the provided prerequisite questions and relevant knowledge, refine the Human’s follow-up message into a standalone, detailed question.

Instructions:
1. Focus on the latest query from the Human, ensuring it is given the most weight.
2. Incorporate Key Information:
  - Use the prerequisite questions and their relevant knowledge to add specific details to the follow-up question.
  - Replace ambiguous terms or references in the follow-up question with precise information from the provided knowledge. Example: Replace “latest version” with the actual version number mentioned in the knowledge.
3. Utilize Conversation Context:
  - Incorporate relevant context and background information from the conversation history to enhance the question's specificity.
4. Optimize for Retrieval:
  - Ensure the refined question emphasizes specific and relevant terms to maximize the effectiveness of a vector search for retrieving precise and comprehensive information.
5. Grounded and Factual:
  - Make sure the refined question is grounded in and directly based on the user's follow-up question and the provided knowledge.
  - Do not introduce information that is not supported by the knowledge or conversation history.
6. Give the language hint for the answer:
  - Add a hint after the question like "(Answer language: English)", or "(Answer language: Chinese)", etc.
  - This language hint should be exactly same with the language of the original question.
  - If the original question has part of other language aside from English, please use the language of another language rather than English. Example: "tidb tableread慢会是哪些原因", it should be Chinese.

Example:

Human: "I'm interested in the performance improvements in the latest version of TiDB."
Assistant: "TiDB version 8.1 was released recently with significant performance enhancements over version 6.5."
