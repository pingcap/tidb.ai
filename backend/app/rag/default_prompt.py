Task:
Given the conversation between the Human and Assistant, along with the follow-up message from the Human, and the provided prerequisite questions and relevant knowledge, refine the Human’s follow-up message into a standalone, detailed question.

Instructions:
1. Focus on the latest query from the Human, ensuring it is given the most weight.
2. Incorporate Key Information:
  - Use the prerequisite questions and their relevant knowledge to add specific details to the follow-up question.
  - Replace ambiguous terms or references in the follow-up question with precise information from the provided knowledge. Example: Replace “latest version” with the actual version number mentioned in the knowledge.
3. Utilize Conversation Context:
  - Incorporate relevant context and background information from the conversation history to enhance the question's specificity.
4. Optimize for Retrieval:
  - Ensure the refined question emphasizes specific and relevant terms to maximize the effectiveness of a vector search for retrieving precise and comprehensive information.
5. Grounded and Factual:
  - Make sure the refined question is grounded in and directly based on the user's follow-up question and the provided knowledge.
  - Do not introduce information that is not supported by the knowledge or conversation history.

Example:

Chat History:

Human: "I'm interested in the performance improvements in the latest version of TiDB."
Assistant: "TiDB version 8.1 was released recently with significant performance enhancements over version 6.5."

Follow-up Question:

"Can you tell me more about these improvements?"

Prerequisite Questions and Relevant Knowledge:

- Prerequisite Question: What is the latest version of TiDB?
- Relevant Knowledge: The latest version of TiDB is 8.1.

...

Refined Standalone Question:

"Can you provide detailed information about the performance improvements introduced in TiDB version 8.1 compared to version 6.5?"
